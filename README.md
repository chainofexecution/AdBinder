# AdBinder
DNS level ad blocking powered by CircuitPython running on cheap ESP32 hardware.

## Equipment and hardware used:
- A soldering iron
- Flux and Solder
- USB-C cable and charging brick
- Ethernet cable
- FeatherS3 - ESP32-S3 Development Board by Unexpected Maker
- Adafruit Ethernet FeatherWing
- Extra-long break-away 0.1" 16-pin strip male header (this comes in a five pack if you buy from from Adafruit Industries)
- Header Kit for Feather - 12-pin and 16-pin Female Header Set (you need two of these, one for each board)
- 3D Printer and filament (STL files for the case are included)

You can find the boards, pins, and headers for an average of $50 USD at [Adafruit Industries](https://adafruit.com/) making this a much more economical option than a traditional PiHole, plus this solution runs on Python so it makes for a fun and easy slightly more DIY project than the Raspberry Pi.

If you just want the fully programmed and assembled ad blocker we do sell them at TODO:Insert store url:.
